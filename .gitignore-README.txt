The special file

  ./info/exclude

functions as a `.gitignore` file for the dotfiles.fit repo.   It contains a single line 

  *

to ignore all files at the top level of ${HOME}.

We cannot use the regular file `.gitignore` as it would be deployed to `~/.gitignore`
and would thus affect ALL other git repositories for the user.
