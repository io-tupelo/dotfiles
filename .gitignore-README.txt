The special file

  ${GIT_DIR}/info/exclude

functions as a `.gitignore` file for the dotfiles.fit repo.   It contains a single line 

  *

to ignore all files at the top level of ${HOME}.

We cannot use the regular file `.gitignore` as it would be deployed to `~/.gitignore`
and would thus affect ALL other git repositories for the user.

With this technique, we can commit a file `~/.gitignore`, which in the 
`dotfiles.git` repo is treated as a regular file. This is used by all OTHER
git repos as the default set of ignore rules.
